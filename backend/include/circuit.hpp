/*
 * == Circuits and circuit elements ==
 *
 * A circuit (class Circuit) is a directed acyclic graph of circuit
 * elements, which is the representation of a computation used by the
 * sheep evaluator.  These circuits are 'arithmetic' rather than
 * logical, and this is reflected in the language used (e.g. we have a
 * gate called 'Multiply' rather than 'And').
 *
 * The circuit is a completely abstract representation of the
 * computation to be performed, and the 'type' over which circuits
 * compute is deliberately not specified by this part of the library.
 * The actual computation (and therefore the type of the values being
 * computed on) is provided by the Context class: refer to the
 * description in context.hpp for how the evaluation of a circuit is
 * performed.  In general it will be over however the library
 * represented ciphertext values (but see below about 'constant' or
 * 'plaintext' inputs).
 *
 * A circuit element is represented by a Gate.  This is an enum, and
 * so has no structure itself (again, their interpretation is provided
 * by a Context class).  The Gates are connected by 'Wires': a Gate
 * along with its input and output Wires are contained in an
 * 'Assignment' class.  A Wire is little more than a name stored as a
 * string.  Finally, the representation of a circuit in the Circuit
 * class is provided by a collection of Assignments.
 *
 * Assignments can have arbitrary fan-in but always have fan-out of
 * one.  Gates with fan-out > 1 (e.g. Swap) may be supported in
 * future.
 *
 * Note that _circuit inputs_ and _assignment inputs_ are different
 * concepts (a gate input is not necessarily a circuit input; a
 * circuit input is in general the input to at least one gate, but it
 * might not be).
 *
 * Wires are compared by their name (of type std::string). This may
 * seem inefficient, but adds negligable overhead to the calculation
 * of the homomorphic operations, which are normally a lot more
 * expensive.
 *
 * Any computation performed by SHEEP is represented as a circuit.  It
 * is maximal for what can be computed by SHEEP: that is, not all of
 * the libraries, or their representation as SHEEP Context types, need
 * to support all of the Gates or any conceivable circuit.  Anything
 * that a library supports that we want to expose should be
 * representable in this form however: this might sometimes
 * necessitate adding a new operation.
 *
 * == Inputs and Constant/Plaintext Inputs ==
 *
 * Most HE libraries support a limited number of operations where one
 * operand is a ciphertext value and the other is a plaintext value.
 * For example, MultByConstant takes a Ciphertext and a Plaintext and
 * returns their product.  The plaintexts for these operations are
 * provided to the circuit as CONST_INPUTS in the circuit input file.
